Generating diverse, realistic, and comprehensive test data is a critical yet often tedious aspect of software testing. Jules can be an invaluable assistant in this area by automating data creation, covering edge cases, helping anonymize sensitive data, and generating data for specific scenarios.

- `// Jules, I need to test a user profile API that accepts user data in JSON format. Generate 10 valid JSON objects representing user profiles. Each object should include fields: userId (integer, unique), username (string, 5-15 alphanumeric chars), email (valid email format), dateOfBirth (YYYY-MM-DD format, user must be at least 18 years old), and isActive (boolean). Also, generate 3 invalid JSON objects: one with a missing required field, one with an invalid email, and one where the user is underage.`
  <sub>Showcases: Generating valid and invalid data, data constraints, specific formats.</sub>
- `// My application processes product information from a CSV file. The CSV has columns: product_id, product_name, category, price, stock_quantity. Generate a sample CSV file with 20 realistic entries. Ensure price is a positive float, stock_quantity is a non-negative integer, and category is one of 'Electronics', 'Books', 'Clothing', or 'Home Goods'. Include some products with zero stock.`
  <sub>Showcases: Generating data in a specific file format (CSV), realistic data variety, and boundary conditions (zero stock).</sub>
- `// Jules, I need to populate a database table named orders for testing. The table has columns: order_id (INT, PK, auto-increment), customer_id (INT), order_date (DATETIME), total_amount (DECIMAL(10,2)), status (VARCHAR(50) - e.g., 'Pending', 'Shipped', 'Delivered', 'Cancelled'). Generate 15 SQL INSERT statements for this table with varied and realistic order data for 5 different customers, ensuring order dates are within the last 6 months and statuses are appropriately distributed.`
  <sub>Showcases: Generating SQL insert statements, relational data considerations, date ranges, and enum-like field values.</sub>
